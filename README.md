# python-testing-cookbook
A formal and methodical coverage of all things Python test-frameworky

Because Python is damn cool, you need nothing more than a standard Python install to exercise all code in this codebase.

All credit to Greg Turnquist for this one - I'm only really paraphrasing and embellishing for my own benefit, as a revision excercise for Python automated testing and as an intro to github. What a great book, btw!
